### this repository

Libint1 has been in the *ab initio* quantum chemistry package Psi4
(psicode.org, github.com/psi4/psi4) since 2009. Internal to Psi4, it
has, since about 2014, built with `cmake`, as designed by @andysim.
@ryanmrichard has reworked and standardized the cmake build and
extracted it as an external project. This repository is libint1
source wrapped up nicely in CMake.
